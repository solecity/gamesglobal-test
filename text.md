**Take Home Assignment**

Please read carefully through the following brief. If you have any questions you can drop David an email (david.farrugia@almondgaming.com). This task will test your technical skills, but also how you design your applications and how well you can work with a brief.

**Brief:**
You are going to create a React application with a menu which redirects to 1 page showing a list of operators. This page should include CRUD functionality along with a search box. All CRUD functionality can be a mocked result.

All operators need to be stored in a database with the below fields:
• First Name
• Last Name
• Date of Birth
• Game Name
• Approval Status (Pending or Approved)

Operators need to have the below validations when created or updated:
• First Name and Last Name shouldn’t be longer than 200 characters.
• Date of Birth must be between 18 and 120 years old.

Non-Functional Requirements:
• The code needs to be version controlled on GIT.
• All test cases should pass. Test cases do not need to have full code coverage, only a couple are required.

**Minimal Tech Stack:**
• React

**Notes:**
• Please keep in mind that your commit history will be reviewed.
• You can use any free framework or library, but please keep in mind that we mainly want to see your coding level.
• You will be graded on the quality of your code and design decisions.
• You can provide additional explanation in your code via comments if required.
• Any assumptions can be listed in the readme.txt file or we can go through them during the code walkthrough interview.
• Not all of the functionality needs to be implemented.

Once completed please email the code repository back to David (david.farrugia@almondgaming.com). Please ensure this is completed before 7 working days of receiving this assessment
